# commands

# clone
it used to download repo on your local machine
command -- git clone <link of your repo>

# status
gives status of repo
command -- git status

# add
it adds the files in repo
command -- git add .  (for all the files that are untracked means git don't know about these files)
command -- git add <file name>

# commit
it saves the changes locally means not the site(github.com)
command -- git commit -m "<msg>" -m "<description>"
use this to verify yourself -> git config --global user.email "ravikanttatiwal1999@gmail.com"

# to commit on the website -- we've to generate SSH key first
first create .ssh folder in c/users/hp, if not exists

ssh-keygen -t <crypto_algo_name(dsa/rsa)> -b <key_len(4096)> -C "<github email>"
for file name -- don't type anything -- just enter
for passphrase -- give anything that u can remember or enter(nothing)

two files will be generated -- id_rsa(private key file), id_rsa.pub(public key file)
open pub file using cat -- cat <directory/id_rsa.pub> 
copy its content
go to github ssh setting
go to add new ssh key, paste the copied content -- ssh key generated 

now link ssh key to ssh agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa    or   ssh-add (it will add default files)

# push 
it uploads local repo to github repo
command -- git push <remote> <branch>
eg. -- git push origin master
eg. -- git push origin main
it will be pushed from where u cloned

# how to create a repo in vscode and then upload in github
1 create a folder
2 go into that folder 
3 git init  -- this will make your folder a repo but locally
4 create some file, add and commit
5 now if u do normal push -- it will show error that it don't know where to upload bcoz there is no connection
6 so to make connection 
7 create a empty repo in github and copy its address and then
8 git remote add origin <url>
9 to see connection -- git remote -v
10 git push -u origin master    (now master bcoz our github has two branches)

# branch -- show all the branches
command -- git branch
